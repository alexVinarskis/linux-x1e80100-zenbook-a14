Subject: [PATCH 1/3] dt-bindings: arm: qcom: Add Asus Zenbook A14 UX3407QA
 LCD/OLED variants

X1/X1 Plus variant of the said device comes in either FHD+ OLED or FHD+
LCD panel, and shares the same model number UX3407QA. It appears LCD
panel's brightness adjustment is PWM backlight controlled, so a
dedicated device-tree is required. Introduce dedicated compatibles with
fallback to 'asus,zenbook-a14-ux3407qa' as they are otherwise the same.
